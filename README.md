A questionnaire on how sustainable you are by determining your sustainability score!

In the project 'how sustainable are you?', I will create a questionnaire that will give you an indication on how sustainable you are for the Earth by giving you a sustainability score.

This questionnaire will include questions on ways of travel, diets, warm water usage, gas usage, energy usage, recycling habits, plastic usage and some other way of life aspects. All these factors determine your sustainability level. 

This project will use tkinter to create the questionnaire and numpy, pandas, math and matplotlib to process the answers and create a sustainability score. Furthermore, it is possible that I will also use other libraries. 

The data I will need are numbers on the emission of cars/planes/trains, emissions of different diets, emissions on warm water, gas, energy, plastic etc. These numbers all will be averages, so this questionnaire will give you an indication and not precise level of your sustainability. The outcome will give you a sustainability score on a scale from 1-10 with 10 being CO2 neutral, 5 being average and 1 being not sustainable. These levels will be determined by the amount of CO2 in kg you emit a year. 

The expected outcome is that most people will have a high sustainability score and I hope I can help people with being more sustainable by confronting them with their sustainability score.
