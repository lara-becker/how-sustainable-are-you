This project contains a questionnaire of four questions that calculates your sustainability score based on the answers on the questions.

To run the project, you need to have Python installed. Then you can run the following command:

```bash
python questionnaire_script.py
```
This program will then ask you to answer the four questions one by one and the required format of the answer is stated per question. 
The output will be the sustainability score on a scale of 1 to 10.
