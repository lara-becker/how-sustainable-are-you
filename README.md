A questionnaire on how sustainable you are by determining your sustainability score!

In the project 'how sustainable are you?', I will create a questionnaire that will give you an indication on how sustainable you are for the Earth by giving you a sustainability score.This score is calculated by comparing the average amount of CO2 emitted of an EU-person with the amount of CO2 emitted by the person filling in the questionnaire based on the answers on the questions. 

This questionnaire will include questions on ways of travel, diets, warm water usage, gas usage, energy usage, recycling habits, plastic usage and some other way of life aspects. All these factors determine your sustainability score. However, this questionnaire only consists of four questions and obviously this will not give a realistic number of your emissions and so your sustainability score will not be viable. 

This project will use tkinter to create the questionnaire in a pop-up window with images and also Python Imaging Library for importing the images.

The data I will need are numbers on the emission of cars/planes/trains, emissions of different diets, emissions on warm water, gas, energy, plastic etc. These numbers all will be averages, so this questionnaire will give you an indication and not precise level of your sustainability. The outcome will give you a sustainability score on a scale from 1-10 with 10 being CO2 neutral, 5 being average and 1 being not sustainable.

The expected outcome is that most people will have a high sustainability score and I hope I can help people with being more sustainable by confronting them with their sustainability score.
